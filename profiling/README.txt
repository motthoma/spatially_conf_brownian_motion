***************************************************************

Use 'profiling_brownconf.py' script to perform profiling of 
main_brownconf.c code from ../code/ directory. Go into script 
to adjust parameters concerning the simulated model to your needs.

Script compiles version of code available from ../code/, performs 
profiling with gprof and writes results in .txt file.
