# Spatially Confined Brownian Motion

Simulation code for **interacting** and **non-interacting** Brownian particles in 2D periodic channels.
The particles undergo overdamped Brownian motion simulated via a stochastic Euler scheme.
External static forces can be applied, but long-range hydrodynamic interactions are **not** included.
Periodic boundary conditions are used, and particle density is kept constant in the interacting case.

## ⚙️ Compilation & Execution

The project is compiled using a Makefile and configured via a text file.

### 🔨 Building

To compile the program, navigate to the `src/` directory and run the `make` command:

```bash
cd src/
make
```

This will produce an executable file named `main_brownconf` in the `src/` directory.

### Parameters & Configuration

Simulation parameters are controlled via a configuration file. The default file is `sim_params.conf`.

-   To run a simulation with the default parameters, simply execute the program:
    ```bash
    ./main_brownconf
    ```
-   To use a custom configuration file, pass its path as a command-line argument:
    ```bash
    ./main_brownconf my_custom.conf
    ```

The configuration file uses a simple `key = value` format. For example:
```
# Simulation Parameters
F = 10.0
parts_per_set = 1
N = 100
```
This approach allows for easy modification of simulation parameters without needing to recompile the code.

If **MPI** is available (e.g., on the *Albeniz* cluster), the code can be parallelized by uncommenting the `MPI_ON` flag in the source files where it appears.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository consists of four main directories:

1.  **`src/`**
    -   Contains the main simulation code, Makefile, and configuration files.
    -   Each simulation run creates a new directory under `../runs/` containing the code and data for that run.

2.  **`doxygen/`**
    -   Contains the [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) configuration for generating documentation.
    -   Run `doxygen` to generate HTML and PDF (via LaTeX) documentation.

3.  **`profiling/`**
    -   Provides an environment for performance profiling with **gprof**. See the README inside for details.

4.  **`visualization/`**
    -   Contains Python scripts for data visualization. The primary plotting script is `mobility_over_time.py`, which uses `PyX` to generate plots like `mobility_over_time.pdf`.

## Code Modules

The code is modular to support different physical models:
-   **Channel Shapes:** Modules prefixed with `conf_` (e.g., `conf_splitter.c`) define the geometry of the confinement.
-   **Particle Interactions:** Modules prefixed with `int_` define the interaction potential between particles, such as hard-core (`int_hardspheres.c`) or Lennard-Jones (`int_lennardjones.c`).
